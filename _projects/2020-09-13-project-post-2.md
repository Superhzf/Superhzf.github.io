# 1. Inspiration

The main purpose for this project is documenting my learning experience. On the top of that, having some experience on machine learning, I am aware of the fact that the math behind all the algorithms basically remain unchanged though new algorithms are germinating almost everyday. Finally, in order to fully understand what is going on behind the algorithms, I decided to implement all the algorithms I have ever experienced using NumPy.

Note that this project will always be under development. Therefore, the project is supposed to be updated frequently.

# 2. What I did

I implemented various algorithms from linear ones to non-linear ones, and from supervised learning to unsupervised learning using pure NumPy except set splitting functions and some metrics.

In addition, I tried to add at least either **one example** or **one unit** test for each algorithm to test whether the algorithms work or not.
