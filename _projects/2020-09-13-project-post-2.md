# Inspiration

The main purpose for this project is documenting my learning experience. On the top of that, having some experience on machine learning, I am aware of the fact that the math behind all the algorithms basically remain unchanged though new algorithms are germinating almost everyday. Finally, in order to fully understand what is going on behind the algorithms, I decided to implement all the algorithms I have ever experienced using NumPy.
