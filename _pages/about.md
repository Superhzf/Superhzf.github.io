**Who am I**

My name is Zefu Hu, and I am a data scientist. My research and engineering interests are mainly
the applications of data science and machine learning techniques in the area of finance and risk management. While I spend numerous time on learning technical skills, I believe those skills are supposed to logically serve the business and solving real-life problems.

I am an open-minded person; I am always looking for my shortcomings and trying to fix it. On the top of that, I'm interested in value investment, I believe the key to investment is not making profit but controlling risk.

**About this site**

The reason why this website exists is that I am convinced that maintaining a personal website is one of an effective way to communicate with others besides talking.

The main purposes of this website are as follows:
* Discuss and document the mathematics and the technical details of data science, machine learning, and statistics.
* Document the implementation of algorithms for solving real problems.
* Present my independent research projects.
* Practice writing
