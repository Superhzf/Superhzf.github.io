## 1. Introduction

Finance is an area where data science solutions are widely used thanks to the data accumulation. In the following several articles, I will write about an old-school solution to measure financial credit risk that is still widely used in big banks.

In this first article of the series, I will talk about some basic concepts.

I assume that readers for this article understand basic credit risk concepts like portfolio, credit score (FICO), and default event.

## 2. Expected loss

**Definition 1.** **Expected Loss** is the amount a lender might lose by lending to a borrower.

Expected Loss is one of the tree (the other two are Unexpected Loss and Exceptional Loss) main sorts of losses that are likely to occur to financial institutions. The formula for **Expected Loss (EL)** is:

$$EL = PD\times LGD\times EAD$$
$where$
  * $PD$ = $Probability$ $of$ $Default$,
  * $LGD$ = $Loss$ $Given$ $Default$
  * $EAD$ = $Exposure$ $at$ $Default$

**Definition 2. Probability of default (PD)** is the probability a borrower is not able to or unwilling to repay their debt in full or on time.

**Definition 3. Loss given default (LGD)** is the proportion of the total exposure that cannot be recovered by the lender once a default has occurred.

**Definition 4. Exposure at default (EAD)** is the total value that a lender is exposed to when a borrower defaults.

In other words, EAD is the maximum that a bank may lose when a borrower defaults on a loan.

An example on the concepts above is buying a house. Suppose a person would like to borrow $400,000 for buying a house. The bank can only lend $320,000 just in case the house would devaluate in the future (this is the concept of **loan to value**). Therefore, **EAD=$320,000**, suppose in the past 25% borrowers default, then **PD=25%**. If the borrower defaults right now, then the bank can sell the house in the market price of $342,000 to recover the outstanding balance, based on this, **LGD=1-342000/320000=5%**. Thus, the current expected loss is **EL=PDxLGDxEAD=25%x5%x320000=$4500**


## 3. Basel II Accord
### 3.1. Introduction
After 2008 financial crisis, the US government requires banks must conduct their business without risking the stability if the economic system are disturbed.

**Definition 5. Capital Adequacy.** Banks are required by the government hold sufficient capital that would allow them to absorb the loss from defaults and other factors that might affect the economic environment.

Capital adequacy is determined as a proportion of its assets which are mainly loans. The capital requirement must take into account the risk associated with the portfolio. The final product is **risk-weighted assets (loans)**.

The capital requirement assumes that the bank must hold a capital that the ratio between the capital and the risk-weighted assets should be larger than a certain percentage. This ratio is called **Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR)**.

The important document that includes how much capital financial institutions need to have, how capital is defined, and how capital is compared against risk-weighted assets is **Basel II Accord**.

The primary purpose of **Basel II Accord** is to ensure that the capital allocation financial institutions carry out its risk sensitivity. The greater the risk a bank is exposed, the greater the amount of capital the bank needs to hold to ensure the overall economic stability.

**Basel II Accord** mainly consists of three parts: **Minimum Capital Requirement**, **Supervisory Review**, and **Market Discipline**.

**Minimum Capital Requirement** deals with three main risks that financial institutions are always facing: **Credit Risk**, **Operational Risk**, and **Market Risk**.

### 3.2. Methods to Model Credit Risk
The **Basel II Accord** outlines three methods to model credit risk: **Standardized Approach (SA)**, **Foundation Internal Ratings Based (F-IRB) Approach**, and **Advanced Internal Ratings Based (A-IRB) Approach**.


As described by the figure below. Under **SA**, the capital requirement is described as the percentage of the total exposure, and banks are required to use data solely from external credit agencies like FICO for individuals and Moody's for corporations. This approach is reliable but not flexible. Under **F-IRB** and **A-IRB**, the capital requirement is described as **EL**. The difference between **F-IRB** and **A-IRB** is that **LGD** and **EAD**, under **F-IRB**, can be calculated solely based on external data like **SA** does. **A-IRB**, on the other hand, can model **LGD** and **EAD** using all available information including both internal and external data resources. For **PD**, both **F-IRB** and **A-IRB** can use all available information.

Note that these three approaches are not completely isolated. A typical credit risk decision process is like a funnel; financial institutions always use **SA** for the first step and filter some customers. Then, the left customers will go into the models built using **F-IRB** approach. Finally, the credit of a smaller amount of applicants will be measured by **A-IRB** approach.

The reason that why banks take this approach is that if banks only use **SA** approach, then banks are required, based on the **Capital Adequacy**, to hold **75% (CAR=75%)** capital of each exposure like loans or credit cards for individuals which is a huge amount of money. With the help of **F-IRB** and **A-IRB** including **SA**, banks can model credit risk more accurately as the result of which financial institutions would not have to hold that much amount of money.

The weights on different approaches vary based on the time and the type of borrowers. At the beginning of the business, **SA** is assigned with a higher weight thanks to the lack of data. Besides, the number of corporations is usually less than the number of individual borrowers, thus financial institutions tend to rely more heavily on **SA** approach for large corporation customers. For individual customers, more complex quantitive methods come into place thanks to numerous data availability.
